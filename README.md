# Task Eleven - Image Hover Disappearance

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates two different methods to make an image disappear when the mouse hovers over it and reappear when the mouse moves away. The first method uses **JavaScript**, and the second method uses only **CSS**.

### Features

- The image disappears when the mouse hovers over it.
- The image reappears when the mouse moves away from it.
- Implemented in two ways:
  1. Using **JavaScript** (No CSS)
  2. Using **CSS** (No JavaScript)

## Files

- **`index.html` (JavaScript Implementation)**: This file contains the implementation using JavaScript. It listens for `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to hide and show the image.
  
- **`onlycss.html` (CSS Implementation)**: This file contains the implementation using only CSS. The hover effect is achieved with the `:hover` selector and the `visibility` property.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meeras14/taskeleven.git
